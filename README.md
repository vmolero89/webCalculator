This is my first practice with HTML5, CSS3 and JS.

It's just a simple web calculator.

In the HTML5 file, I've learned to code buttons and an input field, and how to distribute them through the body with the <div> tag (although, I've read it's not the best way to do it).
In the CSS3 file, I've practiced giving general styles to the same kind of tag (i.e. the <button> tag), but also to give a class to some of them in order to give them a diferent style.
Also, i've learned to aply different styles to the same element in relation with some events (mouse over a button, click a button...). And also I've learned to organize the elements 
declared in the HTML5.

In the JS file, I've learned how to capture an HTML5 element (display), and how to create a function that later wil be captured by the html (appendToDisplay function of each button).

In conclusion, it's been a very good introduction practice.
